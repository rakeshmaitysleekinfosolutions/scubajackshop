Desks and blackboards were salvaged from old schools and worksheets were given at the end of each day by all my “teachers”. On my birthday, I didn’t ask for presents, but for items to fill my classroom, such as construction paper, chalk, crayons and markers. Even at a young age I loved being around children and helping them become successful, confident learners.</p><p style=\"outline: currentcolor none medium; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px none; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\" align=\"left\">They say that “necessity is the mother of invention.” That has certainly been true at Woodland Place, the school I have owned and operated since 1996. With almost 25 years of teaching experience, I often created the content that was used in my classroom. I quickly understood that nature was a catalyst for learning and I have always brought that aspect into my curriculum. This type of learning resulted in the creation of The Adventures of Scuba Jack, a learning website that educates children 2-12 years of age.</p><p class=\"text-center\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">http://www.adventuresofscubajack.com</em></span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\" align=\"left\"><span data-text=\"Our Virtual Field Trips take children 2-12 years of age on amazing learning adventures around the world via their own laptop.

The doors were rigged with a special handle so that two doors could be closed using just one handle. He had decorated the ceiling with skylights because he wanted to bring the beauty of the outside in. Jefferson also loved to hear mockingbirds sing and used to keep at least four at a time, and named his favorite songbird “Dick.”</p><p id=\"a9f2\" class=\"jy jz bx ka b kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ko kp kq fw ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Other gratitude to Thomas Jefferson, as the brain trust behind the idea and design of the University of Virginia and&nbsp;<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"108\" data-srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-300x108.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-768x276.jpg 768w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-425x153.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-600x216.jpg 600w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"300px\" data-src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-300x108.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-100001676 lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-300x108.jpg\" srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-300x108.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-768x276.jpg 768w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-425x153.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4-600x216.jpg 600w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-jefferson4.jpg 1200w\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; max-width: calc(33.3333vw); height: auto; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 10px calc(2rem) 10px 0px; padding: 0px; float: left; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms ease 0ms;\">Charlottesville development.

When he was a young boy,Michelangelo moved to Florence, Italy, where he learned from a great number of creators and artists. Michelangelo had different training, though. He was an apprentice, which means that he studied closely under several expert teachers. Instead of sitting in a classroom, Michelangelo was experimenting with his art.</p><p id=\"c7b5\" class=\"gj gk bx gl b gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dp ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">After this early learning period, Michelangelo moved throughout Italy, continuing to experiment and create paintings and sculptures. Throughout his adult life, Michelangelo worked in three major Italian cities: Bologna, Florence, and Rome. Often, powerful people in Italy would employ or hire Michelangelo to create different types of religious art. In fact, Michelangelo even worked for several popes! We’ll talk about his most iconic paintings and sculptures below.</p><p id=\"b397\" class=\"gj gk bx gl b gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dp ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Michelangelo continued to create art and sculptures until his death. He died in Rome in the year 1564. He was 88 years old, which was a very old age at the time. In the end, Michelangelo is known to be one of the three iconic figures of the High Renaissance in Florence. You have probably heard of the other two figures.

The Sistine Chapel ceiling has many different visual representations of the Book of Genesis from the Bible. The creation of Adam is the highlight here, with God and Adam’s hands nearly touching. The next time you visit Rome, make sure that you stop by Vatican City and check out the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling.

This work is located on the altar wall of the Chapel. While the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel has scenes from the Bible’s Old Testament, The Last Judgment depicts the second coming of Jesus. Interestingly, Michelangelo began working on the Last Judgment 25 years after he finished the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling. It took Michelangelo 4 years to finish The Last Judgment. He was 66 years old when he finished this masterpiece.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Perhaps a crowning work is St. Peter’s Basilica located in Vatican City, and considered the largest church in the world. Compared to the four works above, Michelangelo worked with others in completing St. Peter’s Basilica, including redesigning its famous dome. However, Michelangelo died before St. Peter’s Basilica was complete, while Pope Pius V made sure that Michelangelo’s plans were carried out.<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" data-srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david.jpg 960w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-300x200.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-768x512.jpg 768w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-425x283.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"455px\" data-src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-100001662 lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david.jpg\" srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david.jpg 960w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-300x200.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-768x512.jpg 768w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-425x283.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-michelangelo-david-600x400.jpg 600w\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; max-width: calc(33.3333vw); height: auto; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 10px 0px 10px calc(2rem); padding: 0px; float: right; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms ease 0ms;\"></p><p id=\"3039\" class=\"gj gk bx gl b gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb dp ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">A true Renaissance Man.

Basically, a Renaissance Man is someone who is an expert in many different areas. Michelangelo was certainly a Renaissance Man.

You’ve likely heard of him. His name is Leonardo DaVinci.<br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">One of the most intelligent people to have walked our Earth, his works and thoughts still captivate people around the world. From the Mona Lisa to DaVinci’s early designs for a flying machine, his life can be summed up in one word: fascinating.</p><p id=\"09c3\" class=\"jg jh bx ji b jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy fw ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span class=\"ji le\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">An Unrivaled Thinker and Creator</span><br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">DaVinci was born in the year 1452 in Vinci, which is a small town in Italy. In his early life, DaVinci was educated by Andrea del Verrocchio, who was a painter in Florence. Compared to schools today, artists and creators in the Renaissance era apprenticed under a master. Doing so, they can learn from the master’s successes and mistakes as they created their personal artistic style.<br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">So even though DaVinci did not have a formal education, he is known as a “Renaissance Man.” This is the sort of person that is an expert in many different areas. After learning from his master Verrocchio, DaVinci showed off his talent in cities like Milan, Rome, Bologna, and Venice.<br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">When going through these cities, DaVinci was hired by different powerful individuals to craft different types of works. He is most known for his paintings, but DaVinci was a sculptor, scientist, and architect. Along with these engagements, DaVinci would experiment and take detailed notes in his famous notebooks.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">His life was absolutely fascinating — even beyond his creations and discoveries. In fact, for two years of his life, DaVinci was missing. From 1476 to 1478, few primary sources recorded DaVinci’s activities. Some believe that DaVinci went to a cave where he discovered aliens! According to the theory, he wrote about his discoveries in those notebooks. While the theory hasn’t been proven, it goes to show that DaVinci lived a life unlike many others.<br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">After a life full of beautiful art and fascinating discoveries, DaVinci died in 1519 in France. He was 67 years old.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"></p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span class=\"ji le\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">DaVinci’s Most Famous Works</span><br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">When talking about Leonardo DaVinci, much of the conversation centers on his works and inventions.

At the center of the painting is Jesus, right before he says that one of his disciples will betray him. The disciples have different reactions to the news, with some being angry and others being shocked. Unfortunately, little of the original painting remains. This is because of wear and tear and the passage of time.</p><p id=\"c773\" class=\"jg jh bx ji b jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy fw ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"264\" data-src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci-6a.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" class=\"size-full wp-image-100001652 alignleft lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci-6a.jpg\" sizes=\"191px\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; max-width: calc(33.3333vw); height: auto; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 10px calc(2rem) 10px 0px; padding: 0px; float: left; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms ease 0ms;\">Even though it isn’t strictly a painting, DaVinci’s&nbsp;<em class=\"lr\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Vitruvian Man&nbsp;</em>is also a classic. The&nbsp;<em class=\"lr\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Vitruvian Man</em>&nbsp;is a drawing of a man in two superimposed positions. The man’s arms and legs are separated and are within a circle and square. Ultimately, the drawing is important because it shows DaVinci’s understanding of mathematics, art, and proportion. Experts also argue that the&nbsp;<em class=\"lr\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Vitruvian Man</em>&nbsp;is one of the most important drawings that shows man’s relationship to nature.</p><p id=\"dbed\" class=\"jg jh bx ji b jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy fw ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">DaVinci’s art and drawings alone would make him one of the most influential creators in history. That being said, he didn’t stop there. DaVinci was known as a forward-looking inventor, who came up with concepts and ideas that we continue to see today.</p><p id=\"bdf7\" class=\"jg jh bx ji b jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy fw ap\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">As just one example, DaVinci’s notebooks include inventions for things like musical instruments, hydraulic pumps, mortar shells, and a steam cannon. One of his most fascinating concepts was his earlier designs of a modern-day helicopter. While it doesn’t look much like the helicopters we see today, DaVinci wasn’t far off in thinking of how science and technology would change our world.<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"572\" data-srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3.jpg 750w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-300x229.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-425x324.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-600x458.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"455px\" data-src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3.jpg\" data-sizes=\"auto\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-100001649 lazyautosizes lazyloaded\" src=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3.jpg 750w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-300x229.jpg 300w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-425x324.jpg 425w, https://adventuresofscubajack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-scuba-davinci3-600x458.jpg 600w\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; max-width: calc(33.3333vw); height: auto; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 10px 0px 10px calc(2rem); padding: 0px; float: right; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 400ms ease 0ms;\"></p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ultimately, much of DaVinci’s knowledge can be found in his famous notebooks. He used his notebooks to not only think about creations he was working on, but to think about life as a whole. Clearly, DaVinci was a thinker beyond his time. Even in the year 2020, it’s safe to say that he was one of the most remarkable humans that ever walked our planet.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span class=\"ji le\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One of the Most Fascinating People in Human History</span><br style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none;\">In all likelihood, there will never be another person like Leonardo DaVinci.

From studying under great artists to perhaps discovering aliens, DaVinci was an unbelievable person. Whether you are looking at his pieces of art or the forward-looking ideas in his famous notebooks, I’m sure you can say the same.</p><figure class=\"ke kf kg kh ki kj du dv paragraph-image\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"kk kl cq km ai\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"du dv sf\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"kr r cq ks\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"sg ku r\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"cp kn s t u ko ai av kp kq\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"></div></div></div></div></div></figure><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"></p><figure class=\"ke kf kg kh ki kj du dv paragraph-image\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"kk kl cq km ai\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"du dv rx\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"kr r cq ks\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"ry ku r\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><div class=\"cp kn s t u ko ai av kp kq\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"></div></div></div></div></div></figure></div><div class=\"gp-entry-tags\" style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 30px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: right; line-height: 13px; color: rgb(177, 177, 177); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant-ligatures: none;\"><br></div>', '0', 'Saturday at the Museum', '', '');

Throughout that time, she has achieved countless numbers of awards and praise for her talent. But Dolly isn’t just a gifted musician.

Dolly wasn’t always a world-famous country music star. In fact, she wasn’t a singer in the first place. She was originally a songwriter. Basically, she wrote songs that other musicians would perform. That said, she knew she wanted more. Dolly eventually took a chance and performed on a well-known television show in the 1960s.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Even as she became known as an excellent country music singer, Dolly kept challenging herself. Several years later, she experimented with pop music. This was pretty uncommon. Often, musical artists stay in a particular style of music. Country singers remain country singers and pop singers create pop music. Dolly, however, decided to take a chance—even if her fans didn’t necessarily want her to do so. In the end, it worked out for Dolly, as many of her pop songs were applauded by fans and experts.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Like Dolly, we shouldn’t hesitate to try new things. While we may not be pop stars, we can experiment in our own lives. You can try a new sport or befriend another person in your class. You can even try picking up an unfamiliar and challenging book. By trying different things, you will be building up your courage muscles. And who knows? You may find something or someone new that you really like.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Beyond her willingness to try different things, Dolly is a great role model because&nbsp;<span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">she makes the world a better place</em></span>. Dolly takes the time to support a long list of causes around the world. For example, as part of her Dollywood Foundation, Dolly helps promote literacy on our planet. If you don’t yet know, literacy means the ability to read and write. Dolly and her team mail one book per month to certain children from the time they are born to the time they enter kindergarten. This program has gotten so big that Dolly and her team recently sent out their&nbsp;<em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">100 millionth book</em>. Along with her literacy work, Dolly gives her time and money to causes like the American Red Cross. She even spent time trying to preserve the American bald eagle, which has been endangered.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Dolly has done so much work to improve the world around her. And just as a reminder, this isn’t her full-time job. Still, she finds the time to give back. We can do the same in our own lives. Better yet, we don’t need to send out 100 million books to make a difference. Instead, we can do it on a small level. For example, at school, see if you can work with some of your classmates to support a cause that means a lot to you. You can even do this with your family members. Think about how you want to improve the world and create an idea of how to do it. By following this pattern, you can be like Dolly and make a real difference for our planet.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Finally, Dolly is extremely special&nbsp;<span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">because of her attitude</em></span>. Being a famous musician can be difficult. There are always people watching you and your fans can complain about your work. It can be difficult for lots of celebrities, which makes them feel angry. They can take this anger out on their fans or even their family members.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">This isn’t true with Dolly. If you ever watch an interview of Dolly (or even hear her speak), you will notice that she is extremely positive. She takes a happy view of life and wants to brighten up the days of people around here. Happiness is her goal, whether it is through making a new song or entertaining guests at the Dollywood amusement park.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Dolly’s happiness and positive attitude toward life is something that we can copy. There are so many great things about life, whether that is a best friend, a great grade, or a loving family member. Yet it can be easy to focus on some of the negative things that are happening. I recommend that you act like Dolly and focus on being the most positive person that you can be. It will pay off in the long run.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Be Like Dolly</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: none;\">Dolly is a special person. She has made a huge difference in our world—both in her music and her volunteer work. Even if we don’t like her music or country music in general, there is a lot that we can learn from Dolly.

The Kardashian family is one of the most famous families on our planet today. Their television show, called&nbsp;<em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>, is watched by millions of people. Whenever a member of the family speaks, many people listen.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">While many people do not like the Kardashian family, it is hard to say that they haven’t been extremely successful in their lives. Today, however, we want to focus on one of the younger members of the Kardashian family. Her name is Kylie Jenner and she is the daughter of Kris Jenner, who is the mother of other famous Kardashians like Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Kourtney Kardashian.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Even though Kylie is only 22-years-old, she has already had an incredible amount of success. Most recently, Kylie was named the world’s youngest-ever self-made billionaire because of the success of her business called Kylie Cosmetics. She was also recently named the most influential celebrity in the fashion industry.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">To be clear, you don’t need to become a billionaire to be successful. Life is much more about money or how many people pay attention to you. So you shouldn’t feel sad or feel like you’re wrong if your goal is to make a difference in the world instead of making lots of money. But having said this, we can learn a lot from Kylie’s story. She shows us a lot about bravery, creativity and following our passions.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Lessons From Kylie’s Story</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">For Kylie, it would have been all too easy to take it easy and take advantage of her family’s celebrity. No one forced Kylie to take on all of the stress that comes with being a successful businesswoman. Still, Kylie decided to take a risk and become an&nbsp;<em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">entrepreneur</em>, which basically means a person who starts their own business from scratch.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">There are many things that we can learn from Kylie’s story and use in our own lives. One of the most important things is that&nbsp;<span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Kylie was brave</em></span>&nbsp;when she decided to start Kylie Cosmetics.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Anyone who decides to start their own business must have lots of courage. This is because, to put it simply, starting a business is very tough. Many new businesses have to close over a few years since they aren’t making enough money. But even beyond this, starting a business is scary because it can be embarrassing to fail. No one likes to fail at anything, yet the stakes are higher when starting a business because your friends, family, and others are watching if you fail.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So even though Kylie wouldn’t have run out of money if her business didn’t make it, millions of people would have seen her fail. If that happened, it could have made her feel very sad and maybe could have stopped her from starting new businesses in the future. Even though there was a chance that her business didn’t survive, Kylie took the risk. It paid off, as her business has made hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">No matter what our dreams or goals are, we are going to need to be brave to achieve them. It may be scary, but by following Kylie’s example, we can get much closer to those goals.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Next, Kylie is a great example for us&nbsp;<span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">because of her creativity</em></span>. She didn’t have this grand idea for Kylie Cosmetics at the beginning. Instead, she decided to share her ideas and beauty looks to all of her social media followers. Kylie’s followers on Snapchat, Instagram, and other social media services could watch her try on different types of lip glosses and other beauty products. Kylie showed off her personality and did so in a creative and inspiring way.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One of the scary things for Kylie could have been that she felt like she needed to express herself in a certain way. After all, she was really famous. In fact, she is a member of one of the most famous families in the world. However, she decided to flex her creative muscles. Kylie didn’t hold back and shared her true thoughts on social media. She made extremely interesting videos to watch, which eventually led to Kylie starting her own business.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In our world today, it is easy to think that we aren’t creative. We may compare ourselves to “more creative” people and think we have nothing to share. Nothing can be further from the truth. We all have something special to share, even if our inner voice tells us we aren’t good enough. Ultimately, we should be like Kylie and show off our creative skills and talents.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, Kylie is a great example for us because&nbsp;<span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">she follows her passion</em></span>. Kylie is clearly passionate about beauty products and cosmetics. If she started a business in any other area, it isn’t clear whether it would have worked. But by pursuing her passion, Kylie was able to have a better chance of succeeding. She was extremely interested in the things her business was selling and would work extra hard to make sure her customers were satisfied. It’s hard to have that kind of enthusiasm when you are working on something that doesn’t interest you.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Because of this, don’t hesitate to follow your passion. Even if your dream or passion seems crazy or impossible, pursuing that passion will increase the chances that you succeed. You will work harder and will be motivated to make your dreams become a reality. If you aren’t working on your passion, however, you will find it more difficult to achieve your goals. Keep this in mind as you are thinking about your career or what you want to work on when you’re older.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Using These Lessons In Our Own Lives</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">While we may not have as much fame or money as Kylie, we can use her as an example in our own lives. Kylie is an extremely successful businesswoman who has courage, shows off her creativity, and follows her passion. No matter what our goals are, doing those things will help us turn our dreams into realities.</p><div><br></div></div>', '0', 'How Kylie Jenner Shows the Power of Bravery, Creativity, and Following Your Passion', '', ''),

Even if we have some great ideas on how we can make the world a better place, it can still be hard to convince adults that we are right. It’s all too easy to simply move on with our lives and focus on day-to-day things.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">But that said, it isn’t impossible to make a difference—even as a kid. In fact, there is one terrific example of a girl not much older than you who is making a huge difference in the world. Her name is Greta Thunberg and at 17 years of age, she has already made a huge impact on the worldwide conversation about saving our planet. Greta has made such a difference that she was recently named&nbsp;<em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Time</em>&nbsp;<em style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Magazine’s</em>&nbsp;“Person of the Year,” which is an extremely high honor for anyone in our world.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Whatever your dreams are, there is a lot to learn from Greta. She is a great role model who has a lot to share about following your dreams, never giving up, and being brave.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Greta’s Unbelievable Journey</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Greta was born in Stockholm, Sweden on January 3, 2003. According to her biography, she was eight-years-old when she first heard about climate change, which is basically the idea that rising temperatures around the world are causing environmental damage. Hearing about climate change made Greta very sad. She was so upset that she stopped eating food and lost more than 20 pounds in two months.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Instead of simply being upset about climate change and doing nothing about it, however, Greta decided to act. She challenged her parents to change their behavior to better protect their environment (like not eating meat and even giving up flying). But she didn’t stop there. Greta became a climate activist. She organized a famous school strike for the climate, where kids her age walked out of school for one day to demand action to stop climate change. She sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in a solar racing boat to show her beliefs in fighting climate change. Greta even gave a speech in front of presidents and other world leaders at the United Nations.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Greta is extremely passionate when she delivers her message. She blames adults for not doing enough to fight climate change. She also argues that all of us need to make sacrifices in order to stop permanent environmental damage.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">How We Can Be Like Greta</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Even though she is still a teenager, Greta has had an unbelievable journey. Millions of people know her name and she has inspired countless kids (and adults) to do something to fight climate change.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">There are many things that we can learn and take from Greta’s young journey. One of the key lessons centers on what I talked about earlier. Even though you are young and in school, you certainly have the power to make a difference in the world. In fact, you can get started right now.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Just to remind you, Greta first heard about climate change when she was eight-years-old. Right now, some of you may be that age. You should feel really excited about that. It means that you not only have the ability to understand an issue like climate change, but you can take action to make a true difference.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Granted, it will not be easy to get to Greta’s position. Not many adults have the influence or impact that she has. Still, nothing is stopping you from doing something today to make the world a better place. It can be something as small as changing your behavior (like eating less meat in order to fight climate change). Like Greta, you can even get your family involved. By taking action and starting small, you may make a greater impact than you ever imagined.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Next, one of the most striking things about Greta is that she never gives up. Even when she faced some challenges organizing the school strike for the climate or sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, she persevered. She kept her larger mission in mind and refused to stop—even though it may have been easier to do that. Greta is probably going to face even more adversity in the future, yet her dedication to fighting climate change will help her get through those tough moments.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Whatever our goals are, we are probably going to face some obstacles or challenges. It is a part of life. But when we do face those challenges, we should be like Greta and stay strong. We should keep our goal in mind and have friends or family encourage us. The good news is that by staying strong and overcoming these obstacles, we get stronger, allowing us to overcome even larger obstacles in the future.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, we should follow Greta’s example and be brave. For as much as Greta is doing in our world, she has received some criticism from different types of people. Some people don’t want her to succeed. While this criticism is hard for anyone (including Greta), she doesn’t stop. She continues pursuing her mission, even if it makes other people angry.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">No matter what our goals are, we must rely on bravery and courage to achieve them. So how do we get braver? One part of it is having friends and family who support us. But another part of it is putting ourselves out there and trying different things. It takes practice to be brave or courageous, so the more we do it now, the better off we will be. Even though it may be scary at first, hang in there and continue going after your dreams.</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Get Started Today</span></p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 12px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-size-adjust: none; outline: none; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Greta Thunberg is a great example of a young person who worked hard to make a difference in the world. Ultimately, all of us should follow her lead. We should get started today in working toward a cause or goal that is extremely important to us. Yes, it will take lots of hard work. But we can do it!</p></div>', '0', 'How Greta Thunberg Shows That We Can All Make a Difference in Our World', '', ''),
